Breast cancer biopsy diagnosis using SVM classifier

Workbook looking at using support vector machine to predict biopsy classifications using the UCI Wisconsin breast cancer database dataset. We optimise SVM parameters using Scikit Learn's GridSearch method.

We used Scikit Learn gridsearch to optimise C and gamma hyperparameters for margin and rbf effect.  

The classification works well with only 5% misclassifications, however the recall for malignant class could do with improvng so tha tmalignants are not classed as benign
